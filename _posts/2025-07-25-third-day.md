Woke up at 6:15 AM again. This is apparently just how we live now.

We had a packed day planned: surfing in Poipu, swinging by Kauai Coffee Company afterward, and maybe lunch at Puka Dog before heading back to the resort for a workout. Then we’d wrap up the day with a luau.

## Surfing in Poipu

We met up with our surf instructor, Adam, who—like the bartender at the brewery the night before—had some thoughts about management. Maybe that’s a theme on this island.

The surf lesson was great. If you already sort of know what you're doing, the biggest value in taking a lesson is that you get more time actually *on* the wave. The instructors know exactly where to go and help you catch nearly every set. Definitely worth it for maximizing fun.

Adam gave a really useful tip for staying positioned in the water: find two points on shore (one close, one far) and line them up. If they start to drift out of alignment, so are you. You can do something similar with a landmark down the coast to judge how far out you are.

Brea’s takeaway was all about controlling her balance when catching a wave—staying centered while standing up and adjusting her position on the board. Moving forward adds speed, moving back adds control.

## Kauai Coffee Company

After surfing, we stopped by Kauai Coffee Company for a mid morning pick-me-up. We took a self-guided walking tour and learned how a coffee cherry becomes a cup of coffee. The whole process was surprisingly interesting and it was a mellow stop after being in the water all morning.

We *tried* to get lunch at Puka Dog, but the line was out of control—wrapped around the building and deep into the parking lot. This place has been recommended to us by multiple people but we imme
