## Day 2 – Thursday, July 24, 2025

We woke up early today—6 AM, which is definitely early for us. We made breakfast on the lanai (the balcony): egg bagel sandwiches with this local Hawaiian hot sauce we picked up. It was actually pretty good.

After breakfast, we walked around the resort a bit, then headed over to a nearby farmers market. We picked up some fruit, including a white pineapple, which we hadn't tried before. It's really sweet and not acidic at all. Worth trying if you're ever in Hawaii.

We packed sandwiches and went for a hike on the Ho'opi'i Falls Trail. It's a pretty short hike, but super green and ends at a swimming hole with a waterfall. There was also a house near the trailhead with a painted sign featuring Frog and Toad that said:

> "Where is the trail to Ho'opi'i Falls?" asked Frog.  \
> "Three houses down" said Toad.

We ate lunch there and hung out for a bit.

On the trail we saw this old car chassis off to the side. It looked kind of like an army jeep but also didn’t look that old—the rubber on the tires was still in good shape. I tried to figure out what kind of car it was, but no luck. If anyone has a guess, let us know.

And of course we had to log it on Strava.

In the afternoon, Brea had her remote Medical Spanish course from 3:30 to 6:30. While she was on that, I walked around town a bit, did some shopping, and worked on planning a few more days of the trip.

For dinner we went to Nāpali Coast Brewing Company. I got fish and chips, Brea got a taro veggie burger. Both were solid. We sat at the bar and listened to the bartender complain to the waitstaff about management, which was kind of funny.

After that we just headed back to the resort and chilled. Went to bed early. Felt like a really long day—in a good way.
