# Crème Brûlée

## Ingredients
- 4 cups heavy cream
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 6 egg yolks
- 1 cup sugar (1/2 cup for mixture, 1/2 cup for crust)

## Instructions
1. Heat heavy cream and vanilla extract in a saucepan until hot but not boiling.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk egg yolks and 1/2 cup sugar until well mixed. Gradually pour in the hot cream while mixing continually.
3. Place six (7–8 oz) ramekins into a large roasting pan. Pour hot water into the pan until it comes roughly halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
4. Pour the egg mixture into the ramekins and bake at 325°F (165°C) for 45–50 minutes, until set but still slightly jiggly in the middle.
5. Remove ramekins from the roasting pan, allow to cool to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.
6. Remove from refrigerator at least 30 minutes before browning the sugar. Spread 1 tbsp sugar on top of each custard.  
   - Using a torch: melt sugar until crispy.  
   - Without a torch: broil, keeping a close eye to avoid overcooking.
7. Allow to sit for at least 5 minutes before serving.
