# Espresso Martini

A rich and indulgent cocktail that perfectly balances the bold flavors of coffee with the smoothness of premium spirits. This elevated version offers flexibility in spirit choice and optional chocolate notes.

## Ingredients

- **2 oz** base spirit
  - *Recommended:* Reposado tequila (for complexity)
  - *Alternatives:* Dark rum, premium vodka
- **1 oz** coffee liqueur
- **1 oz** fresh espresso (cooled to room temperature)
- **0.25-0.5 oz** simple syrup
- **2-3 dashes** bitters
  - Chocolate bitters
  - Black walnut bitters
  - *Or both for complexity*

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the espresso:** Brew a fresh shot of espresso and allow it to cool to room temperature.

2. **Combine ingredients:** Add all ingredients to a cocktail shaker filled with ice.

3. **Shake vigorously:** Shake hard for 15-20 seconds to create a beautiful foam layer and properly chill the cocktail.

4. **Garnish:** Float 3 coffee beans on top of the foam, or add a light dusting of cocoa powder for extra richness.
