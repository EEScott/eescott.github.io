# Espresso Martini

2oz base spirit (I prefer reposado tequila, some rum, others are simple and like vodka)

1 coffee liqueur (Mr black or khalua)

1oz espresso (split this with Gorda double chocolate liqueur if you please)

.25-.5 simple

Chocolate bitters or Black walnut bitters or both if ya fancy


# Lemon Aoli

1 cup store-bought mayonnaise*
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste
2 teaspoons fresh lemon zest, plus more to taste
1 garlic clove, finely grated
Kosher salt

Add mayo, lemon juice, lemon zest and garlic to a medium bowl, whisking to combine. Season to taste with salt and more lemon juice and zest (I added 1/2 tablespoon more lemon juice and 1 teaspoon more lemon zest to the batch shown here). Store aioli in fridge for up to 2 weeks.

# Artichokes

Saw off the top 1/4 of the artichoke and the stem; snip off the pointy part of all the leaves with a scissors.

Give a good, repeated dunking in cold water to clear out any residual sand and grit.

In a large pot add about 2-3 inches of cold water and a sprinkling of garlic salt. Place the artichokes on a steamer just out of the water (you can also use sterilized bricks or jar lids in place of a steamer, but really they are cheap and ridiculously easy to find).

Cover the pot (prevents oxidation/browning) and steam the artichokes for ~45 minutes. You'll know they're done when you can stab the bottom with a fork and it slides in like buttah.

For the saucy goodness: whip together mayo (NOT Miracle Whip), a little lemon, and some softened/melted butter.

Pluck off the leaves one by one, dip, run the inside of the bottom portion of the leaf across your bottom teeth, enjoy.

When you've gotten down to the purple "choke", carefully carve off the furry portion from the base of the artichoke (the heart), dip the heart in your sauce, and snack that nommy goodness down.
