- Were going to do a north shore day but decided to take it easy and spend time at the local beach
- Lava lava for breakfast
- Tamba for surf board rentals
  - Went to Kealia beach for surfing
  - Time to exercise our newly learned skills fromt eh surf lesson
  - Spent 5 hours on the beach
  - Caught a few waves each
  - Saw the life gaurd save someone who got stuck getting sucked out in teh rip current, they weren't drowning or anything but he knew they needed help and sprung into action before it became an issue. Brea was thoroughly impressed.
- Bobby V's for dinner, itallian place in coconut marketplace. We shared a hawaiian style pizza and an itallian chopped salad and the house cab sav, which was from St. Helena... 
- Got shave ice after dinner
  - There was an older security guard who was being friendly with us.
    - early in the conversastion he asked us "you know why September 22 is the best day of the year?" ... because it's his birthday! Which is the same day as Brea's birthday. He was quick to point out that the years were probably pretty far apart though. 
- Bed, exhausted from surfing all day.
